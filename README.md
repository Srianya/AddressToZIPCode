# Address-to-Zipcode

Address-to-Zipcode is a GUI-based, desktop-executable, offline-storage compatible,
Python application.

## Features

- Use your Google API geocoding and reverse-geocoding keys
- Get latitude and longitude from address
- Get zipcode from latitude and longitude
- Returns zipcode

## Tech

Address-to-Zipcode uses a number of modules to work properly:

- [Tkinter] -  standard Python interface to the Tcl/Tk GUI toolkit!
- [Python] - Programming language.
- [Google API: geocoding] - give information about latitude and longitude using given address
- [Google API: reverse geocoding] - give zipcode using latitude and longitude values
- [Pyinstaller] - to convert file into .exe

## Prerequisites

Before you continue, ensure you have met the following requirements:
1. You have installed the version of Python3.
2. Replace "api_key" in config.py with your own google API key.
```bash
touch config.py
api_key = YOUR GOOGLE API KEY
key = config.api_key 
```
## Quickstart
1. Run on command-line
    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```
    or 
Clone and run main.py
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Asaxena-2120/API-Address-to-zipcode.git
    ```
2. Download the executable from [here](https://github.com/Asaxena-2120/API-Address-to-zipcode/releases)

## Installation
1. Install requests, Tkinter modules
 - Address-to-Zipcode requires [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run.
